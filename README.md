# orbital2019catch
Catch is based on the idea of helping people earn money without working, which will be useful for people who are looking to earn some side cash but are unable to commit to a real job for any reason. Users can complete surveys and give feedback to companies for some cash out. This will benefit companies by helping them learn more about consumer preferences/knowledge. Companies will also be able to use our app to pull off viral marketing stunts, such as through the hosting of live giveaways or live activities.
